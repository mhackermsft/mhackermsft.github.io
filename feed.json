            "content_html": "<p>Azure Kubernetes Services is not a one-size-fits-all tool. An organization can tailor AKS to meet its goals in several ways, ranging from single-node development clusters to dynamically scaling, high-performance clusters for production workloads. In this webinar, we will look at all the knobs and switches you can use to shape AKS to align with your app needs. We’ll cover autoscaling, node pools, and virtual nodes to give you the whole gamut of all the possibilities.</p>\n<p>LIVE WEBINAR | THURSDAY, OCTOBER 21ST 2PM EDT WITH BLAIZE STEWART<br><a href=\"https://www.wintellect.com/webinar/optimizing-compute-on-azure-with-azure-kubernetes-services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Register here</a></p>",

The cool thing about Azure Kubernetes Services is that it can connect to all of them, so you can match the storage performance and cost goals of just about any application. In this webinar, we’ll look at how to connect AKS to Azure Blob Storage, Azure File Storage, Azure Disks, and Azure NetApp Files to give you the full scope and scale of these options. Then we’ll compare them compare the cost and performance considerations.</p>\n<p>LIVE WEBINAR | THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 4TH 2PM EDT WITH BLAIZE STEWART<br><a href=\"https://www.wintellect.com/webinar/azure-storage-options-with-azure-kubernetes-services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Register here</a></p>",
