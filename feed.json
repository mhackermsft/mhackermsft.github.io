Something is wrong.</p>\n<p>It's been found through several years of industry-wide reports that elite DevOps practitioners deploy on-demand (1+ per day) to production, regardless of industry. What's exciting is that if you're using Kubernetes, you have a lot of the capabilities to safely deploy at an increased frequency.</p>\n<p>In this webinar, you will learn various deployment strategies so that you can stop with the 50+ person deployment meetings, endless deployment checklists, release trains, and mind-numbing dependency tracking.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/registration/kUhhxUpBuU2FBD-rLfuf8w,rhFM28eeJkCqeYV4SoPbJA,fZcZkSHcRUW3i7-tu_A8UA,y8CUYyfIOkukuTOTFr-GtA,LOU8UigRdU2a1VjDSPwX9g,QuD-z6CjSE2cnquOWJhIKQ?mode=read&amp;tenantId=c5614891-414a-4db9-8504-3fab2dfb9ff3&amp;skipauthstrap=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Learn more and register here</a>!</p>",
