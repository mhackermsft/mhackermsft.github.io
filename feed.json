While the concepts themselves seem simple, it’s not always clear when one might want to use one or the other or even what constitutes one of the others. In the webinar, we’ll look at both of these and the supporting services on Azure that can make the Hot Path and Cold Path make sense. We’ll look at services like Event Hubs, Service Bus, Data Lakes, Data Factory, Stream Analytics, and others that support these workloads.</p>\n<p>Learn more and register <a href=\"https://atmosera.com/resources/event/webinar-hot-path-vs-cold-path-which-one-should-my-data-take/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>",

The ultimate computer network is the Internet, which has practically connected all the world’s devices to a single network where any device can send a message to another device. For this reason, there are tons of solutions that provide messaging infrastructure to help broker messages between different kinds of clients and for different use cases. Azure alone has at least eight different services that systems can use to send messages. Some of these are general-purpose, while others are purpose-built.</p>\n<p>In this webinar, we’ll show eight different services, when to use them, and some demos of how a few of them work! We’ll look at Storage Queues, Message Bus, Event Hub, Event Grid, IoT Hub, SingnalR Service, Notification Hub, and Send Grid.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Femail.atmosera.com%2Fe3t%2FBtc%2FZU%2B113%2Fd118VN04%2FVWplP82rxZpHW5X1zYp79YspGW5DT7xy4CTMF3N4CDgdJ5nCVBV3Zsc37CgZFmW19XPCw6B6Bq9W3Sf7tN3ZMslZW91nLhk5mhhG7N771_LQ2d0zTW8p-P5g7bVL5dW6V9P0Y8rM1vNW9lWxyq5HmsxhW77wvpB6GvP_lW1HLGkg1lgzzwVj7g305VB1MlVB3bKR9cw_78W1YZ9125fP_FgW5qTj-q98W_6cW5zckLn4JG4wbN1tk_ZHHl7D2W1XxgyS6nKshqW4j7-228djRbkN100CqXL7pRvW8XlXSy4FtD5qW5CJN7y5SFcDQVTB-hQ4jNj6GW4hW_s496d7CFW2JglRY4Xm5wpVjZmKz4sCBHdW5lcfFg6fQ9NWW55g1_N5qwChBW3txCKw5Qw9NVW8PjDGm1zQZ92W8-WkV63xmBrDVkgdtQ8s8wd-V2hyHL1-XzBpW67gxH64CtGNSW5NMRc284yt9jW8LxWqn15mlLyW7lX2Z18QXqPDW7gCSvG7LK0yzW7fF-TR1mBFCbVgbWw78dX54D31Vk1&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cmhacker%40microsoft.com%7C37ee588577734a07a03c08d9ceef9b64%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637768351322663781%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=vgD%2BdKClGvfEJRnrHGD2VMNuARgpYLvXwqhnqJ6N3dI%3D&amp;reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Learn more and register now</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><em>Hosted by BoxBoat on December 14, 2021, 2pm - 3:30pm Eastern Time Zone</em></p>\n<p>Are you using Kubernetes but still deploying application changes to production once per sprint, once per month, or once per a couple of months? Something is wrong.</p>\n<p>It's been found through several years of industry-wide reports that elite DevOps practitioners deploy on-demand (1+ per day) to production, regardless of industry. What's exciting is that if you're using Kubernetes, you have a lot of the capabilities to safely deploy at an increased frequency.</p>\n<p>In this webinar, you will learn various deployment strategies so that you can stop with the 50+ person deployment meetings, endless deployment checklists, release trains, and mind-numbing dependency tracking.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/registration/kUhhxUpBuU2FBD-rLfuf8w,rhFM28eeJkCqeYV4SoPbJA,fZcZkSHcRUW3i7-tu_A8UA,y8CUYyfIOkukuTOTFr-GtA,LOU8UigRdU2a1VjDSPwX9g,QuD-z6CjSE2cnquOWJhIKQ?mode=read&amp;tenantId=c5614891-414a-4db9-8504-3fab2dfb9ff3&amp;skipauthstrap=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Learn more and register here</a>!</p>",
