However, extracting meaningful insights from large and complex datasets can be challenging and time-consuming. Moreover, citizens expect more from government services in terms of user experience and speed of access.</p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">This is where Azure OpenAI Service can help. Azure OpenAI Service provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models including the GPT-4, GPT-3, Codex and Embeddings model series. These models can be easily adapted to your specific task including but not limited to content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation. You can access the service through REST APIs, Python SDK, or our web-based interface in the Azure OpenAI Studio.</p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">In this blog post, we will show you how to use Azure OpenAI Service to perform some common tasks that can benefit government agencies and their citizens. We will also discuss some best practices and responsible AI considerations when using generative models.</p><h1>Content generation</h1><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">One of the most popular applications of Azure OpenAI Service is content generation. You can use the service to generate text for various purposes such as reports, newsletters, emails, social media posts, etc. You can also customize the tone, style, and format of the generated text by providing some examples or parameters.</p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">For example, suppose you want to generate a newsletter for your agency that highlights some of the recent achievements and initiatives. You can use the GPT-4 model series to generate a draft of the newsletter based on some bullet points. Here is an example of how you can do that using Python SDK:</p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle"><code>from azure.openai import GPT4Client<br></code><code>client = GPT4Client("&lt;your_api_key&gt;")<br></code><code>prompt = """<br></code><code>Generate a newsletter for our agency based on these bullet points:<br></code><code>- We launched a new website that provides easy access to our services and information<br></code><code>- We received an award for excellence in customer service from the National Association of Government Agencies<br></code><code>- We partnered with a local university to conduct a research project on improving public health outcomes<br></code><code>- We are hiring new staff members for various positions<br></code><code>The newsletter should:<br></code><code>- Have a catchy title<br></code><code>- Have an introduction that summarizes the main points<br></code><code>- Have a paragraph for each bullet point that provides more details<br></code><code>- Have a conclusion that thanks the readers and invites them to contact us for feedback or questions<br></code><code>- Have a professional and positive tone<br></code><code>"""<br></code><code>response = client.completions(prompt, model="gpt-4", stop="\n\n")<br></code><code>print(response.text)</code></p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">The output might look something like this:</p><blockquote><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">Our Agency's News: A New Website, An Award, A Research Project, And More!</p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">Hello,</p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">We are excited to share with you some of the latest news and updates from our agency. We have been working hard to improve our services and deliver value to our citizens.

We would love to hear from you.</p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">Sincerely,</p><p>&lt;Your_name&gt;<br>&lt;Your_title&gt;<br>&lt;Your_agency&gt;</p></blockquote><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">As you can see, the GPT-4 model series can generate coherent and relevant text based on the given prompt. However, you should always review and edit the generated text before using it for any official purpose. You should also be aware of the potential risks and limitations of content generation, such as factual errors, plagiarism, bias, or harmful content. We will discuss more about responsible AI later in this post.</p><h1 class="ParagraphTextStyle">Summarization</h1><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">Another common task that can benefit from Azure OpenAI Service is summarization. You can use the service to summarize long and complex texts into shorter and simpler texts that capture the main points and key information. This can help you save time and resources, as well as improve readability and comprehension.</p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">For example, suppose you want to summarize a research paper that is relevant to your agency's work. You can use the Codex model series to generate a summary based on the abstract or the full text of the paper. Here is an example of how you can do that using Python SDK:</p><p><code>from azure.openai import CodexClient</code><br><code>client = CodexClient("&lt;your_api_key&gt;")</code><br><code>prompt = """Summarize this research paper based on its abstract:</code></p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle"><code>Title: The impact of COVID-19 on public health and social services: A systematic review and meta-analysis</code></p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle"><code>Abstract: Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to public health and social services worldwide. However, the evidence on the impact of COVID-19 on these sectors is still limited and fragmented.</code></p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle"><code>Objective: To systematically review and synthesize the existing literature on the impact of COVID-19 on public health and social services, and to identify the gaps and priorities for future research.</code></p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle"><code>Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases for studies published from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 that assessed the impact of COVID-19 on public health and social services. We included studies that reported quantitative or qualitative data on outcomes such as service delivery, utilization, quality, access, satisfaction, workforce, costs, and policy responses. We excluded studies that focused on clinical aspects of COVID-19 or non-health-related sectors. We performed a narrative synthesis and a meta-analysis of the quantitative studies using random-effects models.</code></p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle"><code>Results: We identified 8,734 records and included 176 studies in the review. The majority of the studies were from high-income countries (82%), used observational designs (85%), and focused on specific services or populations (79%). The most common outcomes were service delivery (59%), service utilization (55%), and workforce (36%). The narrative synthesis revealed that COVID-19 had a negative impact on public health and social services in terms of reduced availability, accessibility, and quality of services; decreased service utilization and satisfaction; increased workload and stress among staff; and increased costs and budget constraints. The meta-analysis showed that COVID-19 was associated with a significant decrease in service utilization across different types of services, with a pooled relative change of -0.34 (95% CI: -0.42, -0.26). The heterogeneity among the studies was high (I2 = 99%). The quality of the evidence was low to moderate according to the GRADE approach.</code></p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle"><code>Conclusions: COVID-19 has had a substantial impact on public health and social services, affecting both the supply and demand sides of these sectors. There is a need for more comprehensive, comparative, and rigorous research to assess the long-term effects of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of policy responses on public health and social services."""</code></p><p><code>response = client.completions(prompt, model="codex", stop="\n\n")</code><br><code>print(response.text)</code></p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">The output might look something like this:</p><blockquote><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">A possible summary is:</p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">This paper reviews how COVID-19 affected public health and social services around the world in 2020. It finds that COVID-19 reduced the availability, accessibility, and quality of these services; decreased their use and satisfaction; increased the workload and stress of staff; and increased costs and budget constraints. It also finds that COVID-19 reduced service utilization by 34% on average across different types of services. It calls for more research to evaluate the long-term effects of COVID-19 and the policy responses on these sectors.</p></blockquote><h1 class="ParagraphTextStyle">Semantic search</h1><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">Another useful task that can benefit from Azure OpenAI Service is semantic search. You can use the service to search for relevant information or documents based on the meaning and context of your query, rather than just the keywords. This can help you find more accurate and comprehensive results, as well as discover new insights and connections.</p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">For example, suppose you want to search for best practices and guidelines for reopening schools during the COVID-19 pandemic. You can use the Embeddings model series to generate a semantic vector for your query and compare it with the semantic vectors of various documents or sources. Here is an example of how you can do that using Python SDK:</p><p><code>from azure.openai import EmbeddingsClient</code><br><code>client = EmbeddingsClient("&lt;your_api_key&gt;")</code><br><code>query = "best practices and guidelines for reopening schools during the COVID-19 pandemic"</code><br><br><code>query_vector = client.embeddings(query)</code><br><br><code>documents = [    "CDC - Operational Strategy for K-12 Schools through Phased Prevention", "UNICEF - Framework for reopening schools", "WHO - Considerations for school-related public health measures in the context of COVID-19", "OECD - Education responses to COVID-19: Embracing digital learning and online collaboration",    "World Bank - Reopening Schools: When, Where and How?"]</code><br><code>document_vectors = client.embeddings(documents)</code><br><br><code>scores = client.similarity(query_vector, document_vectors)</code><br><br><code>results = sorted(zip(documents, scores), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)</code><br><br><code>for result in results:</code><br><code>    print(result[0], result[1])</code></p><p> </p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">The output might look something like this:</p><blockquote><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">CDC - Operational Strategy for K-12 Schools through Phased Prevention 0.86</p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">UNICEF - Framework for reopening schools 0.84</p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">WHO - Considerations for school-related public health measures in the context of COVID-19 0.83</p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">World Bank - Reopening Schools: When, Where and How? 0.81</p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">OECD - Education responses to COVID-19: Embracing digital learning and online collaboration 0.76</p></blockquote><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">As you can see, the Embeddings model series can rank the documents based on their semantic relevance to the query. The higher the score, the more relevant the document is. You can then access the documents and read more about the topic. You can also use semantic search to find similar or related documents within a corpus or a database.</p><h1 class="ParagraphTextStyle">Natural language to code translation</h1><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">Another interesting task that can benefit from Azure OpenAI Service is natural language to code translation. You can use the service to translate natural language descriptions or instructions into executable code snippets in various programming languages. This can help you save time and effort, as well as learn new skills and techniques.</p><p class="ParagraphTextStyle">For example, suppose you want to write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of the numbers. You can use the Codex model series to generate a code snippet based on your natural language description. Here is an example of how you can do that using Python SDK:</p><p><code>from azure.openai import CodexClient</code><br><code>client = CodexClient("&lt;your_api_key&gt;")</code><br><code>prompt = """Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of the numbers."""</code><br><code>response = client.completions(prompt, model="codex", stop="\n\n")</code><br><code>print(response.text)</code></p><p>The output might look something like this:</p><p><code>def average(numbers):</code><br><code>    # check if the input is a valid list of numbers</code></p><p><code>    if not isinstance(numbers, list) or len(numbers) == 0 or not all(isinstance(n, (int, float)) for n in numbers):</code><br><code>        return None</code></p><p><code>    # calculate the sum of the numbers</code><br><code>    total = 0</code><br><code>    for n in numbers:</code><br><code>        total += n  </code></p><p><code>    # calculate and return the average</code><br><code>    return total / len(numbers)</code></p><h1>Responsible AI</h1><p>As we have seen, Azure OpenAI Service can enable many powerful and useful applications for government agencies and their citizens. However, it is also important to be aware of the potential risks and limitations of using generative models, and to follow some best practices and responsible AI principles when using the service.</p><p>Some of the challenges and considerations when using Azure OpenAI Service are:</p><p> - Factual errors: The models are trained on large and diverse datasets that may contain inaccurate or outdated information. Therefore, the generated text may not always be factually correct or consistent. You should always verify the accuracy and validity of the generated text before using it for any official purpose.</p><p> - Plagiarism: The models may generate text that is similar or identical to existing sources, which may violate intellectual property rights or academic integrity. You should always check the originality and attribution of the generated text before using it for any public or academic purpose.</p><p> - Bias: The models may reflect or amplify the biases or stereotypes that exist in the training data or in the society. Therefore, the generated text may not always be fair, inclusive, or respectful to different groups of people. You should always monitor and mitigate the potential bias or harm of the generated text before using it for any sensitive or impactful purpose.</p><p> - Harmful content: The models may generate text that is inappropriate, offensive, or harmful to individuals or groups of people. This may include profanity, hate speech, violence, misinformation, etc. You should always filter and moderate the generated text before using it for any public or personal purpose.</p><p>To help you address these challenges and considerations, Azure OpenAI Service provides some features and resources such as:</p><p> - Content filtering: The service evaluates the prompts and completions against our content policy with automated systems. High severity content will be filtered. You can also specify your own content filter preferences in the request parameters.</p><p> - Quality rating: The service provides a quality score for each completion, which indicates the confidence and coherence of the generated text. You can use this score to filter out low-quality completions or to request a new completion.</p><p> - Responsible AI guidance: The service provides a set of guidelines and best practices for using generative models in a responsible and ethical way. You can find these resources in our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> and our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Responsible AI portal</a>.</p><p>We encourage you to use Azure OpenAI Service in a responsible and ethical way.
