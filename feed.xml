                    <p><img src="https://blog.mikehacker.net/media/posts/62/covid_hero_desktop.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Woman sitting in front of computer running Microsoft Power Apps" /></p>
                <p>In today's fast-paced business environment, organizations are under constant pressure to deliver value to customers quickly and efficiently. One way to meet this challenge is by using low code solutions such as <a href="https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Power Apps</a> to build and deploy applications.</p>
<p>Low code solutions allow non-technical users to create custom applications by dragging and dropping pre-built components, rather than writing code from scratch. This can save a significant amount of time and effort, and can make it easier for organizations to build and deploy applications quickly.</p>
<p>There are several benefits to using low code solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Speed and agility: Low code solutions can help organizations build and deploy applications faster, as they do not require the same level of technical expertise or coding knowledge. This can help organizations respond more quickly to changing business needs and deliver value to customers more rapidly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased productivity: Low code solutions can also increase productivity by empowering non-technical users to build and customize applications themselves, rather than relying on IT or professional developers. This can reduce the workload for IT and developers, allowing them to focus on more strategic tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost savings: Low code solutions can also help organizations save money by reducing the need for specialized skills and resources. Non-technical users can build and maintain applications themselves, which can lower the costs of development and maintenance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some professional developers may be hesitant to adopt low code solutions due to concerns about the quality or flexibility of the resulting applications. However, low code solutions have come a long way in recent years, and can now support a wide range of capabilities and customization options. Additionally, professional developers and low code developers can work together to ensure that the resulting applications meet the necessary standards and requirements. For example, professional developers can build APIs that low code developers can use, which can help to extend the capabilities of the application and improve its integration with other systems.</p>
<p>Low code solutions can be a valuable tool for organizations looking to build and deploy applications quickly and efficiently. By leveraging the benefits of low code and working together with professional developers, organizations can deliver value to customers faster and respond more effectively to changing business needs.</p>

                <p>One common theme I hear when speaking with customers about Application Modernization is that they don't have the budget or that they can't dedicate the necessary resources to complete a modernization project.  It is true that Application Modernization will have a cost and that it will require dedicated resources.  But, does it really make sense to not invest in modernization and instead continue on legacy applications?</p>
<p>It is important to look at the bigger picture and identify the potential risks and costs of not doing anything.  Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Security risks: Legacy applications may be more vulnerable to security threats such as hackers, malware, and data breaches, due to their outdated technology and lack of support. Modernization can help address these security risks by updating the application with the latest security protocols and patches, as well as incorporating features such as encryption and authentication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compliance risks: Government agencies may also face compliance risks if they continue to use legacy applications that do not meet current regulations or standards. Modernization can help ensure that the application is compliant with relevant laws, policies, and industry standards, which can help prevent costly fines, legal issues, and reputational damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost of maintenance and support: Continuing to support and maintain a legacy application can also be costly, as it may require specialized skills and resources that may not be readily available. Modernization can help reduce these costs by simplifying the application, improving its maintainability, and leveraging the latest tools and technologies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Modernizing an application can also help reduce technical debt by addressing the underlying issues that contribute to technical debt in the first place. Technical debt is the cost that an organization incurs when it takes shortcuts or makes trade-offs that compromise the long-term quality or maintainability of its systems. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a lack of resources, time, or skills, or a need to meet short-term goals.</p>
<p>Over time, technical debt can accumulate and become a significant burden on an organization, as it can lead to a number of problems, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reduced performance: Technical debt can slow down the performance of an application, as it may require more resources and processing power to run. This can lead to a poor user experience, as well as increased costs for infrastructure and support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased maintenance costs: Technical debt can also make an application more difficult and costly to maintain, as it may require specialized skills or resources to fix or update. This can lead to increased maintenance costs and a higher risk of failure or downtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced flexibility and agility: Technical debt can also limit an organization's ability to respond to changing business needs or take advantage of new opportunities. It may be difficult or costly to make changes or updates to an application with high levels of technical debt, which can limit the organization's flexibility and agility.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By modernizing an application, an organization can address the underlying issues that contribute to technical debt and reduce the costs and risks associated with it. Modernization can involve a variety of activities, such as updating the technology stack, refactoring the code, improving the architecture, and introducing best practices and standards. By taking these steps, an organization can improve the performance, maintainability, and agility of its applications, and reduce its technical debt.</p>
<p>Overall, modernization may be a necessary investment for a government agency to address the risks and costs associated with legacy applications. By carefully evaluating the potential benefits and costs, and developing a clear roadmap and plan for modernization, the agency can make informed decisions about whether and how to modernize their legacy applications.</p>

                <p>Modernizing applications is an essential part of any business' digital strategy. It helps organizations stay competitive, improve efficiency, and enhance the user experience. In this blog post, we'll explore the benefits of modernizing applications and why it's important to do so.</p>
<p>One of the main benefits of modernizing applications is increased efficiency. Outdated applications can be slow and cumbersome, causing delays and frustration for users. Modernizing these applications can help streamline processes and improve the speed and performance of the application. This can lead to increased productivity and a better user experience.</p>
<p>Another benefit of modernizing applications is the ability to integrate new technologies and features. As new technologies emerge, it's important for businesses to be able to take advantage of them in order to stay competitive. Modernizing applications allows organizations to incorporate new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, and offer more advanced capabilities to their users.</p>
<p>In addition to increased efficiency and the ability to incorporate new technologies, modernizing applications can also improve security. Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, and outdated applications may not have the necessary security measures in place to protect against these threats. Modernizing applications can help ensure that they are secure and compliant with industry standards and regulations. According to a report by Cybersecurity Ventures, cybercrime is expected to cost the world $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. Modernizing applications can help protect against these threats and prevent costly data breaches.</p>
<p>The importance of modernizing applications is clear, but what about the tangible benefits? According to a survey conducted by Digital Shift, modernizing applications resulted in an average of 20% cost savings for organizations. It can also lead to increased revenue, with another survey finding that modernizing applications resulted in a 20-30% increase in revenue for businesses.</p>
<p>In conclusion, modernizing applications is an essential part of any digital strategy. It can lead to increased efficiency, the ability to incorporate new technologies, improved security, and cost savings and increased revenue.
