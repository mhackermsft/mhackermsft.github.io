                <p>Migrate to Modernize is an approach for application modernization that enables organizations to see immediate value while also addressing common modernization challenges.</p>
<p>Modernizing an application means to pay back that technical debt and to enable the application to take advantage of modern platform services. Modern platform services enables organizations to focus more on solving business challenges and provides more value by not having to focus on hardware, patching and server maintenance.</p>
<p>The fastest way to modernize is to first migrate your applications to Azure. Once the application is in Azure you can begin to modernize parts of the solution by replacing virtual machines with platform services. For example, you can replace the SQL database VM with Azure SQL, that IIS server with Azure App Service, and modernize the applications identity to use Azure Active Directory for authentication.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mphacker_msftadvocate-azure-government-activity-7056263142070243328-a9sM?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is a short video</a> that explains the Migrate to Modernize approach.</p>
<p>Below are a few recommendations and things to consider with using the Migrate to Modernize approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quickly get started by modernizing the database first by utilizing Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, MySQL, or PostgreSQL platform services.</li>
<li>Migrate the application VMs to Azure and reconfigure the application to utilize the new hosted database service</li>
<li>Establish policies that incentivize completing the full application modernization process within an acceptable timeframe.</li>
<li>Developers should modernize the application to utilize modern authentication solutions such as Azure Active Directory and Azure AD B2C.</li>
<li>Developers should upgrade the code to utilize the latest frameworks and libraries to help protect against security vulnerabilities. </li>
<li>Architects and developers can work together to determine the best platform services to use for hosting the updated application. Options include services such as Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Container Apps, Azure Red Hat OpenShift, and Azure App Service.</li>
<li>Architects and developers can consider decomposing the application into microservices and APIs that can be hosted on container or serverless platforms.</li>
<li>Architects and developers can begin to look for options to enhance their application with other platform as a service features such as Logic Apps, Service Bus, Redis Cache, Configuration Services, Functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key point is that you start with modernizing the database while migrating the application. From there you can begin to modernize components of the app while receiving the benefits of using database platform services and having access to a wide range of additional platform services for your application.</p>
<p>To get started today, speak with your Microsoft Account Team for details on how they can assist you with your modernization journey.</p>

                <p>Recently while I was working on a customer demo I ran into a bit of an issue when trying to delete a record from a Cosmos DB using Logic Apps.  I kept receiving an error indicating that the document id I was specifying didn't exist even though I could see it was in the database. I was also running into similar issues when trying to retrieve a specific document from the database.</p>
<p>The Logic Apps actions I was using included the <em>Delete a document (V2) and Get a document (V2).  </em></p>
<p>I searched through documentation and found nothing that seemed to give any clear indication as to what the error was. I did some searches using Bing and found other folks who were having similar challenges but I didn't run across any one specific way to fix it. Everyone seemed to just be guessing as to what the issue was. </p>
<p>In those actions, there are required fields which include Cosmos DB account name, database ID, Collection ID and Document ID.  In most cases you will need to also add the parameter Partition key value in order for the delete or get actions to find the proper document.  In my database, the Document ID and Partition key values are the same. </p>
<p>My Logic app is acting as a REST API to do basic CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations.  When a client calls the REST API it passes in a value which is stored as the variable id, which represents the id of the document I wish to get or delete.  Originally I was just taking that id variable and placing it in both the Document ID and partition key value fields in the Logic Apps action. As logical as that sounds, this did not work and I kept getting errors related to the document not being found.</p>
<p>So what ultimately fixed the issue?  The Partition key value needs to be surrounded by double quotes.  That's it.  Once I placed double quotes around this field, my Logic Apps started functioning correctly.</p>
<p>Hopefully this little nugget of information comes in handy for someone else who is running into similar challenges with the Cosmos DB actions for Logic Apps.</p>

                <blockquote>
<p><em>Note: Portions of this blog post were written using Bing Chat.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) are two options for deploying and managing containerized applications on Azure. Both services are based on Kubernetes, the open-source platform for orchestrating containers, but they have some differences and trade-offs that you should consider before choosing one over the other.</p>
<p>AKS is a fully managed Kubernetes service that offers serverless Kubernetes, an integrated continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) experience, and enterprise-grade security and governance. AKS is optimized for running general purpose containers, especially for applications that span many microservices deployed in containers. AKS supports Kubernetes-style apps and microservices with features like service discovery and traffic splitting. AKS also enables event-driven application architectures by supporting scale based on traffic and pulling from event sources like queues, including scale to zero. AKS does not provide direct access to the underlying Kubernetes control plane, which means you have less control and customization options over your cluster.</p>
<p>ARO is a fully managed OpenShift service that provides a consistent hybrid cloud foundation for building and scaling containerized applications. OpenShift is a distribution of Kubernetes that adds additional features and integrations to enhance the developer experience and enterprise readiness of Kubernetes. OpenShift provides a web console, an integrated image registry, a built-in CI/CD pipeline, a source-to-image tool, a service catalog, and many other tools to help developers build, deploy, and manage applications. OpenShift also offers more security features than AKS, such as role-based access control, security context constraints, network policies, and encryption. ARO provides direct access to the underlying Kubernetes APIs and control plane, which gives you more flexibility and customization options over your cluster.</p>
<p>The pros and cons of each service depend on your specific use case and requirements. Some general considerations are:</p>
<p>- If you want a fully managed Kubernetes experience with minimal configuration and maintenance, AKS may be a good choice.</p>
<p>- If you want a more comprehensive platform that includes additional tools and integrations for developing and deploying containerized applications, ARO may be a better option.</p>
<p>- If you need direct access to the Kubernetes control plane, or if you want to use OpenShift-specific features or extensions, ARO is the only option.</p>
<p>- If you need to scale your applications based on events or traffic, or if you want to leverage serverless containers, AKS has more support for these scenarios than ARO.</p>
<p>- If you are concerned about security and compliance, ARO may offer more features and capabilities than AKS to meet your needs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the best way to choose between AKS and ARO is to try them out for yourself and see which one suits your needs better. You can get started with AKS using the quickstarts or with ARO using the tutorials.</p>
